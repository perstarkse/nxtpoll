      <p class="mb-4">Here, you have the option to create a poll using either the standard one vote per question format or to employ a form of weighted voting known as <strong>quantitative voting</strong>. In quantitative voting, participants can assign different weights to their votes, reflecting the intensity of their preferences or opinions.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">In quantitative voting, the process unfolds as follows:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li><strong>Vote Weighting:</strong> Participants indicate the strength of their preference on a scale, such as 1-5, or using other metrics, thereby assigning a weight to each vote.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> nxtPoll collects and processes these weighted votes, offering a more nuanced view than standard voting methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> The results are then analyzed to uncover not just popular choices, but also the levels of conviction behind them, highlighting areas of strong consensus or passionate minority views.</li>
        <li><strong>Insightful Feedback:</strong> You gain in-depth insights into the group's dynamics, aiding in more informed decision-making.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">This approach goes beyond merely tallying opinions, by quantifying the intensity behind them, making it invaluable in contexts where understanding the depth of group sentiment is as important as knowing the predominant view.</p>
